# Instructions  

Check out PP 5.8 on Page 251. Its goal is to create a simple slot machine.

Create your own rules to customize the slot machine.

Remember to list the rules as comments and also display them to the user. You can optionally add a bid amount. You MUST use Math.random() and While loops.

Do not forget to include a block comment with name, author, and purpose of the program.

The block comment will also include the rules for your slot machine.



Failure to follow instructions will result in reduced credit.
